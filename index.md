### CPSC 120

* **Lab 3**

    Lab 3, part 2 was something I really enjoyed making just because it's nice to know
    how far things into the future things you have are. One of my friends does art
    commissions and sometimes she has set due dates but doesn't know how many days she has
    to get some of her things completed so this little project made it fun for me to help
    her check "oh yeah you have *x* amount of days until this commission is due!" which I
    think is just really fun! It can also help with classes when the professor doesn't really
    use canvas, for example my philosophy class last semester didn't use canvas so if we were
    given a date for something you'd have to manually count how long until the date is but this
    program solves that problem if I were to ever have it in the future! During this lab we used
    Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithm in order to convert days into Julian Days and then get
    the difference between the two! We also used cin and cout statements to take our input as
    well as give us our output.

* **Lab 4** 

    I think both part 1 and 2 for Lab 4 were very fun for me to create and use! With part 1
    I've never been great at unit conversion and am pretty deadset on following the instructions
    when cooking so being able to have a program that will just let you know all the different
    conversions is pretty helpful if I'm being honest. When it comes to part 2, it's something that
    was just fun to create and use in a class I took last semester I created a python character guessing
     game based off League of Lends which was fun, so creating something a bit different with the given
     higher or lower feature was super fun to do! Within this lab I was able to do lots of different
     mathematical equations and use different functions that ended up being a trickle effect in order to
     be able to see any of the given units you wanted! When it came to part 2 we were able to save the
     secret number we inputted into the computer and store it and then we would compare the guess number
     to that secret number and see if it was *correct*, *higher*, or *lower*!

* **Lab 6**

    For this lab I think that both parts were pretty interesting to make, but out of the two I think
    that part 1, which was madlibs was more fun for me to use! I remember whenever I would go to certain
    diners or other restaurants when I was a kid they would have little paper madlibs that I would play
    along with my family so it was a nice little throwback to things I used to do when I was younger.
    Part 2, which was the blackjack score was cool as well, but I already know how to play blackjack
    so it's fairly easy for me to be able to keep track of all the scores so although it was interesting
    to make it wasn't as fun for me to use as the madlibs part was. In the madlibs part of the lab we used
    the command line arguments which was really cool, we had to have a certain number of arguments or the entire
    program wouldn't work and give us our required output, so in the lab's case if we didn't have 3 arguments like
    the type of bread, protein, and condiment then it wouldn't run correctly!
